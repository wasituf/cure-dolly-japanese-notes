= 6. Adjectives

- The い ending adjectives work the same as adjectives in English.

  - Adjectives can be used as the main engine like: ペンが赤い「あがい」。
  - They can also be used as modifiers for nouns as a white engine like:
    赤いペンが。。。「赤いペンが地裁」(The red pen is small).

- Any verb in any tense can be used like an adjective. Example:
  症状が歌った「しょうじょがうたった」。(The girl sang) -> 歌った症状。。。(The
  girl who sang...)

  - Entire verb trains can be adjectival. 犬がじしょを食べた (The dog ate the
    dictionary) -> じしょを食べた犬が。。。(The dog who ate the dictionary...).
    For example:「じしょを食べた犬がやんちゃだ」(The dog who ate the dictionary
    is naughty).

- Nouns can be made adjectival by converting the だ to a な. 犬がやんちゃだ (The
  dog is naughty) -> やんちゃな犬が。。。(The naughty dog...). For example:
  やんちゃな犬がねている (The naughty dog is sleeping).

  - Not all nouns are adjectival nouns.
  - の is the possessive particle. It can be used like an apostrophe-s in
    English.
  - Non-adjectival nouns can be modified using の. So for something like
    ピンクいろ (pink color), we use の to make it adjectival. So,
    ピンクいろのデレスが (The pick dress...)
