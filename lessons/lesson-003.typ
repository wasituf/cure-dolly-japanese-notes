= 3. は、に and logical vs non-logical particles

- *は* is a flag that marks the topic of a sentence.

  - は can be attached to nouns.
  - は is a non-logical particle.

- Use of *は*:

  - 私*は*アメリカ人だ。 (As for me, I am American). - Important to distinguish
    that 「私は」 literally means "As for me", not "I am".
  - 私は*0が*アメリカ人だ。 - The A (が carriage) part is still there, just not
    visible.
  - In this case, 私 is the subject of the sentence, but it is not nessecarily
    the case for every sentence. For example saying 私は肉「にく」だ。 when
    asked for a restaurant order doesn't mean "As for me, I am meat", it means
    "As for me, I'll have meat." (important to distinguish that "order"/"meal"
    is the subject here, inferred from context). The が version of this would be
    私は飯「めし」が肉だ。

- *に* is a logical particle that marks the indirect object.

  - に tells us about the destination of the action.

- Use of に:

  - 私がボールを桜*に*投げる「なげる」。 (I throw the ball to/at Sakura).

- Logical vs non-logical particles:

  - The logical particles が, を, and に tell us about what's happening in the
    sentence. They directly affect the meaning of the sentence.

  - Non-logical particles can't change the meaning of a sentence:

    - 私は桜にボールを投げる。 (As for me, I throw the ball to/at Sakura).
    - ボールは私が桜に投げる。 (As for the ball, I throw it to/at Sakura).
    - The meaning of the sentences don't change even though we switch the は
      particle from 私 to ボール。 This is because non-logical particles cannot
      change the meaning of a sentence. が is marking the subject, に is marking
      the indirect object/destination, and を is marking the object. は is used
      here simply to put emphasis on either the subject (私) or the object
      (ボール).
    - を is still present in the second sentence, just invisible. -
      ボールは私が桜に0を投げる。 (object is inferred from context established
      by the topic marker は).
