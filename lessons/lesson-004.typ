= 4. Tenses in Japanese

- Japanese has 3 tenses.

- The base form of a verb is the non-past tense, same as the dictionary form of
  an English word.

- The 'ru'/'u' ending of a verb is the non-past tense. So, 犬「いぬ」が食べる
  means "The dog will eat / The dog eats".

- To make the sentence continuous , we can use the いる particle. So,
  犬が食べている would mean "The dog is eating". Here いる is a state-of-being
  particle, and 食べて is considered a white engine. White engine meaning it's
  not carrying the sentence, but it does provide logcical information to the
  main engine 「いる」。

- To make a verb past tense, we add た to the end. So, 犬が食べた means "The dog
  ate".

- To make a sentence future tense, we add a time noun to the beginning. So,
  明日「あした」ケーキを食べる。 means "Tomorrow, I will eat cake".

  - 明日「あした」 here means "tomorrow", and it is a relative-time noun.
  - Relative-time nouns do not require a particle when prefacing a sentence.
  - For absolute-time nouns, we have to use the に particle. So,
    6時にケーキをたべる。 means "At 6 o'clock, I will eat cake".
    - This is the same as when we use "on", "at", or "in" in English for
      absolute time nouns.
