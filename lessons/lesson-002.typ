= 2. Invisible carriages, and を particle

- In Japanese, both A & B are not always visible. A might be invisible.

- Extra carriages (C, D, etc) carry additional information.

- *を* is particle attached to nouns.

  - を provides extra structure/logical information to the sentence, but it is
    not part of the core sentence.

- Use of *を*:

  - 肉「にく」*を*食べる「たべる」。(I eat meat). - が is invisible here, but
    exists.
  - *0が*肉を食べる。- 0 is the subject ("I" in this case) inferred from
    context.
